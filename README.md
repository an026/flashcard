## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was challenging to get the cards to flip properly (at first only the words flipped), and I ran into an edge case where the user did not flip the card back before clicking next. However, I was able to resolve these issues. I also used a while loop to make sure the user will not get the same answer:question pair that they currently have.
